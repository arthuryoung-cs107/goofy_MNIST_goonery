While presenting a substantive workload, I think that this course had some of the most helpful and constructive feedback I have experienced from a class. I think that Professor Pan's grading philosophy, which I'm sure would be regarded as "charitable" by many teachers, was productive in a way I would not have initially expected.

This class is demanding in workload in a way that I found exhausting at first. However, the fact of the matter is that completing the in class and weekly homework assignments at the rate that was asked was a feat by itself. Because the homework feedback was not punitive but fully formative made sure that the student was not focused on receiving "good grades" but on the exploration of content.

This class was everything I could have asked from a graduate level course. I'm so glad that I experienced it in my first term as a graduate student, and I will defend the quality of this curriculum, the grading philosophy, and the instruction by Professor Pan to anyone who asks.

While I understand the principle of the flipped learning model, I think Professor Pan's in-person instruction is much more engaging than her recorded lectures. It's not that her recorded lectures aren't good, it's more that I believe Professor Pan's strength as a lecturer is her ability to "read the room" and clarify/augment her instruction based on the response of her students, even in a Zoom setting. I think that if Professor Pan gave summary of the pre-recorded lectures in the first 5-10 minutes of the class, followed by questions and in class exercise, the students would more easily get their bearings when it came to the assignments. This may require restructuring of the in-class experience, and perhaps Professor Pan could come up with a better solution, but I urge her to not to discount the quality of her active responses to questions, and consider ways to inject that more directly into her class.

The class content was primarily delivered in "short form" (i.e. lectures, slides, notebooks/code-snippets), but I think if Professor Pan provided her own "long-form" content delivery, the students would have an easier time constructing the narrative that we seek to understand the content.

I think that shortening the homework assignments into a more continuous format, so that instead of answering several small questions we answered a one or two bigger questions would help us generate continuity between concepts. Note that MANY of the assignments actually followed the latter description, but a couple of them were more of the former description. I also think that more frequently indicating where previous code/concepts completed in earlier assignments fit into the present assignment would be welcome, though once again, many assignments did this already and I'm simply saying doing more of that would be good. Overall, I think that the assignments were very good.

I truly believe that Professor Pan and her TA's non-punitive grading model delivered some of the best feedback I have had. I understand that this may come off as entitled, but at this point in my academic career, I think the "grind for grades" mentality is not very helpful in the further exploration of my chosen subject. I feel that the student was rewarded for the effort required to complete the high-level work at the rate it was assigned with good grades and thorough explanation of things that could be improved. I think most students feel very much satisfied.

A strong background in python programming as well as familiarity with linear algebra and probability theory.

I learned that machine learning is a powerful though highly vulnerable subject. Its general capability to model non-linear phenomena motivates its widespread application, and yet its limitations are mathematically identifiable, and practically observable. As the world continues to apply machine learning methods, we must carefully attend to the shortcomings of these algorithms to maximize the positive impact of our advancements.

Was very helpful when we remembered to use it
